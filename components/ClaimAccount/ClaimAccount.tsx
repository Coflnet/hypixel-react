                    The referral bonus for inviting someone is only awarded after verifying with a minecraft account. You receive free test premium after you
                    verified your account. This is to prevent people from abusing the ref system by creating new emails.

                    As part of our fairness system unverified accounts receive flips delayed. Some parts (like the in game `/cofl profit`) use the list of
                    verified accounts to compute summaries over all your minecraft accounts.

                        within 5 minutes please try again.
